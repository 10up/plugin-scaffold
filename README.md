# 10up Plugin Scaffold

> At 10up, we strive to provide digital products that yield a top-notch user experience. In order to improve both our efficiency and consistency, we need to standardize what we use and how we use it. This plugin scaffold allows us to share initial set up procedures to make sure all projects can get up and running as quickly as possible while closely adhering to 10up's high quality standards.

## Dependencies

1. [Node >= 8.11 & NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - Build packages and 3rd party dependencies are managed through NPM, so you will need that installed globally.
2. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Webpack is used to process the JavaScript, CSS, and other assets.
3. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Composer is used to manage PHP.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start
Install 10up's command line tool for scaffolding new projects. You can download it from the [Project Scaffold repository](https://github.com/10up/project-scaffold). Setting up a new plugin is as easy as running `create-10up plugin plugin-name-here` in the terminal!

Browsersync requires a local development URL. This is currently set in the `package.json`, as `proxyUrl`.

### Direct Install
- Clone the repository
- Rename folder plugin-scaffold -> your project's name
- If copying files manually to an existing plugin directory instead of cloning directly from the repository, make sure to include the following files which may be hidden:

```
.babelrc
.browserslistrc
.editorconfig
.eslintignore
.eslintrc
.gitignore
```

The NPM commands will fail without these files present.

- Do case-sensitive search/replace for the following:

	- TenUpScaffold
	- TENUP_SCAFFOLD
	- tenup-scaffold
	- tenup_scaffold

- `cd` into the plugin folder
- run `npm run start` to build the front-end assets

## Webpack config

Webpack config files can be found in `config` folder:

- `webpack.config.dev.js`
- `webpack.config.common.js`
- `webpack.config.prod.js`
- `webpack.settings.js`

In most cases `webpack.settings.js` is the main file which would change from project to project. For example adding or removing entry points for JS and CSS.

## NPM Commands

- `npm run test` (runs phpunit)
- `npm run start` (install dependencies)
- `npm run watch` (watch)
- `npm run build` (build all files)
- `npm run build-release` (build all files for release)
- `npm run dev` (build all files for development)
- `npm run lint-release` (install dependencies and run linting)
- `npm run lint-css` (lint CSS)
- `npm run lint-js` (lint JS)
- `npm run lint-php` (lint PHP)
- `npm run lint` (run all lints)
- `npm run format-js` (format JS using eslint)
- `npm run format` (alias for `npm run format-js`)
- `npm run test-a11y` (run accessibility tests)

## Composer Commands

`composer lint` (lint PHP files)

`composer lint-fix` (lint PHP files and automatically correct coding standard violations)
